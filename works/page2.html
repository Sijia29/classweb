<p>“When I’m on deadline, I find myself listening to a lot of Robyn on repeat — <a href="page3.html">songs like ‘Monument’ or, lately, ‘Missing U.’ </a>(Also, the soundtrack of ‘In the Mood for Love.’) Listening to her songs always puts me in a relaxed and happy mood and helps me let go of what might be swirling in my mind, and gets me to focus on sketching what’s right in front of me. I like her music because it really connects on an emotional level and also on a physical level. I feel like it pushes me to work harder and dig deeper. Robyn’s ‘Show Me Love’ was actually the first single I ever bought with my pocket money! I distinctly remember buying it at the Virgin Megastore on Champs Élysées, so we go way back.”
