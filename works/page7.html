<p>“If I have to pull an all-nighter, I play the ‘Sex and the City’ box set in the studio. My favorite episode is the one when Carrie falls on the catwalk. I just love her uplifting spirit — to accept failure in life and get right back up — because that’s just what real people do. It’s a very positive message when putting the collection together! Also the song ‘Got to Be Real’ by Cheryl Lynn is just too good. I used it in my spring 2014 show finale. Besides that, ‘Project Runway’ season finales are very good options, too, especially the early seasons with Michael Kors as a judge. Kelly Cutrone’s ‘Kell on Earth’ is also super great. I love her honesty and her famous quote: <a href="page8.html">‘If you have to cry, go outside!’</a>”
