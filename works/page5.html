	<p>Josep Font of Delpozo</p>
<p>“Because I love having natural light, I always show around midday — which makes for an early morning. Each season, I follow the same ritual: <a href="page6.html">I like to eat my breakfast of avocado toast with my orange, lemon and ginger juice, but to have it calmly.</a> Then I go to the venue. Even if I’m not staying close to the show, I like to walk there. It’s a moment of peace for me, before the craziness starts of models arriving, music rehearsals, last-minute changes and backstage interviews.”
