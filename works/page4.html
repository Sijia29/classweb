<a href="page5.html">“I tend to get into putting songs on repeat, especially in the studio around show time — and it can drive the team mad!</a> Right now, it’s Billie Holiday over and over again, especially ‘I Loves You Porgy’ and ‘All of Me.’ I find her music very relaxing. I’ve been listening to her music since I was about 15 years old, so it’s so familiar now I don’t find it distracting. I used to listen to Hank Williams on repeat, but everyone knew all the words (and it was really making everyone insane).”
