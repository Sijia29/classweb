<p>“I always need a bottle of water with me. <a href="page9.html">When I’m really stressed, I make sure to stay hydrated.</a> I think this comes from doing a lot of sports when I was young (I played tennis for 15 years), and I was always told that when you run a lot, you should drink a lot — and the more stressed you are, the more you find yourself running everywhere. I prefer small bottles because I usually keep a bottle in my bag, but last season, I designed a jacket with a pocket made specifically to hold a water bottle when I go out.”
