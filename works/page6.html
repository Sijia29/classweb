	<p>Massimo Giorgetti of MSGM</p>
<p><a href="page7">“I take a short trip to London to do research with my creative team at the start of each season — that’s twice a year, once at the beginning of the spring and once in autumn.</a> During those few days and, especially, nights, the inspiration for the new collection is born. At the end of our first day there, as part of our ritual, we always reserve a table at Dukes Bar in Mayfair, one of my favorite cocktail bars in the city. The atmosphere is quintessentially British, and the martini cocktails created by Alessandro Palazzi are incredible! After a couple of hours, slightly inebriated from the atmosphere and perhaps the alcohol, we move to Quo Vadis, a gorgeous restaurant in Soho where you can taste my favorite British food.”
