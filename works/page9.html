<a href="page10.html">“I carry prayer beads with me wherever I go.</a> Sometimes, in the studio, I’ll walk around holding the beads with my hands under my chin, in prayer mode, mouthing the words from the Buddhist Lotus Sutra. But often I’ll just hold the prayer beads as I go about my day, feeling the energy. Both approaches give me peace under pressure and calms me down.”
