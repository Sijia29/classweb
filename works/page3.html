“When it comes to physical things (like bringing something tangible to fruition), <a href="page4.html">I listen to this playlist I’ve made called ‘Hype Me.</a>’ It has Jadakiss and the Lox, DMX, Black Rob, G. Dep, Young Jeezy, Rick Ross and Project Pat on it — a lot of late ’90s, early 2000s gangsta rap — and that’s what I put on when I need to speed up my process. I love DMX, so that’s usually how I start. I’m very rhythmic, so if I’m playing Sade in the background, I’ll move slow, but if I’m playing DMX, I’ll move faster. I’ve had the same playlist since 2006, when I was in college and it was on my iPod, and I keep adding to it; now it’s 124 songs.”
