<p>“I watch episodes of ‘Nighty Night’ by Julia Davis pretty much all the time, especially with a deadline or late at night when I work — I usually listen to it more than watch, as I’m always working on other things. It’s a very dark English sitcom, at times totally surreal and at other times it totally hits the nail on the head. The main character is a sociopathic heroine always dressed in a wardrobe of red, black and pink. The second season is said to have been not as popular as the first, but I sometimes find it even funnier; I always seem to pick up on other more subtle jokes the more and more I listen. It literally makes me LOL.”
