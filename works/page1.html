<p>“I’m lucky enough to live next to one the most beautiful parks in Paris, Buttes-Chaumont. It’s quite big and labyrinthine. Each morning leading up to my show, very early when the park is almost empty, I go for a walk, with no precise directions — even if it’s dark, raining or cold. This is my necessary transition between night life, sleep, dreaming and the crazy working days that follow. During my walk, I’m able to slow down and put my ideas in order. I get a little lost, and then I find the right direction and an exit. In a way, it’s like  <a href="page2.html">repeating</a> the creative process.”
